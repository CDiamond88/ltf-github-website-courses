<h2 id="instructions-for-contributing">Instructions for contributing</h2>
<p>Only modify the markdown (<code>.md</code>) files, not the html or any other files.</p>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> : version control software that manages projects and allows many people to contribute to a project.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> : a Microsoft-owned web platform that hosts Git-managed projects and provides tools for users to raise issues and questions on projects and merge thier own changes to a project.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> : a simple plain text document format that is very portable and easy to modify.</li>
<li><a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> : tool to convert to and from many file formats. For example, it can generate PDFs, websites, and presentations from Markdown text files.</li>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>GNU/Linux and Mac OSX</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Gnu Make</a> : simple tool that automatically detects changes in source materials and re-compiles dependencies. In our examples, this involves automatically &quot;compiling&quot; websites and presentations using Pandoc whenever there are changes to the Markdown files.</li>

<li><p>Windows</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Any help from Windows users on what is used?</strong> Could install <code>make</code> with Cygwin, but seems overly complicated.</li>

<h3 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a> : an alternative to Microsoft's Github. A (possibly biased) comparison with Github is available on <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/devops-tools/github-vs-gitlab.html">Gitlab's website</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://shakebuild.com/">Shake Build</a> : an alternative to Make with a little bit more of a learning curve but with more features and the benefits of access to a full programming language in Haskell. I (Adam) use this primarily, mostly because I use Haskell primarily. Many other languages also have build systems, and it can be beneficial to use a build system embedded in the language you prefer (e.g. <a href="https://scons.org/">SCons</a> in Python, <a href="https://ruby.github.io/rake/">Rake</a> in Ruby).</li>
<li><a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org mode</a> - an alternative to Markdown with advanced personal organizational tools integrated into the Emacs text editor.</li>

<h2 id="the-center-for-teaching-and-learning-ctl-and-this-workshop">The <a href="https://ctl.columbia.edu/">Center for Teaching and learning</a> (CTL) and this workshop</h2>
<p>This event is sponsored by the <strong>Lead Teaching Fellowship</strong>, which is a professional development program for graduate students at Columbia University committed to advancing pedagogy.</p>
<p>The CTL has a lot of great programming that I would recommend for anyone interested in teaching. Specific for doctoral students, there is the <a href="https://ctl.columbia.edu/graduate-instructors/programs-for-graduate-students/ctl-teaching-development-program/">CTL Teaching Development Program</a>, the <a href="https://ctl.columbia.edu/graduate-instructors/opportunities-for-graduate-students/lead-teaching-fellows/">Lead Teaching Fellowship</a> (sponsered this event), the <a href="https://ctl.columbia.edu/graduate-instructors/opportunities-for-graduate-students/teaching-observation-fellows/">Teaching Observation Fellowship</a>, and <a href="https://ctl.columbia.edu/graduate-instructors/opportunities-for-graduate-students/teaching-assessment-fellows/">Teaching Assessment Fellowship</a>. If you are interested in any of the fellowships, I think enrollment in the Teaching Development Program would strengthen your application.</p>
