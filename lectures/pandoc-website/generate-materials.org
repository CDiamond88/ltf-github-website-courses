* Generate course materials from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown][Markdown]] using [[https://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]]

------

***** General workflow

1. Accept pull requests from contributors.
2. Pull updated repository onto computer.
3. Run [[https://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]] on Markdown files to generate websites and
   presentations. This can be automated using a "build tool" like [[https://www.gnu.org/software/make/][Gnu
   Make]], which automatically detects which markdown files are changed,
   and runs the required Pandoc commands to generate content.
4. Commit updated content and push back to repository.
