### What are Git and Github

-   Git was created for collaborative software development. It tracks
    all changes made to files, and can merge together changes made
    separately by different people.
-   Github is a web platform owned by Microsoft that hosts Git projects
    and provides complementary tools.

### Git steps in command form

-   `git add <filename>` : stage a file to be committed
-   `git commit` : commit your changes to the repository with a message
-   `git push` : push your changes to a remote repository like Github
    (backup)
-   `git pull` : pull any remote changes on Github to your computer.

## Github features

----

### How can Github's features be useful for deploying and organizing course materials?

-   Take a moment to write a few thoughts down on your own, in your text
    editor or on scrap paper (1 min)
-   Share your thoughts with the person next to you (3 min)
-   Group discussion (3-5 min)

----

### Let's collaborate on this workshop

1.   Fork the
    [repository](https://github.com/massma/ltf-github-website-courses).
2.   Enable Github pages
3.   On your version of the repository, edit workshop files (\*.md) to
     improve the workshop on Github.
4.   Or, if you installed Git you can clone your version of the
     repository to your local computer and edit with your text editor
     of choice. Recommended if you plan on using these tools a lot.

----

### Ideas for contributions

-   Add your name and uni to the attendees section of the website
    landing (index.md)
-   Improve any errors or confusing spots in the slides
-   Open an issue if something was confusing but you do not know how to
    fix it.
-   Add content to the [main
    website](https://massma.github.io/ltf-github-website-courses/index.html),
    or to some initial websites hosting resources
    for [EEAE
    students](https://massma.github.io/ltf-github-website-courses/index.html)
    and [Water Center
    people](https://massma.github.io/ltf-github-website-courses/sample-websites/water-center-resources.html).

----

### Let's merge our changes

-   Submit a pull request to my original repository, which will request
    to add your changes.
-   I will then re-generate content with pandoc (next presentation)
