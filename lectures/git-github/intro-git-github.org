** Learning objectives

    - How to use Git to manage projects.
    - How to publish a website using Github.
    - How to manage content with simple markdown text files.
    - How simple text files and git ease collaboration and rapid

      and collaborate on the deployment of courses.

** Introductions

   Please introduce yourself to the person sitting next to you,
   sharing your position and area of study or research.

   Then we will go around the room and each person will introduce the
   person next to them.


** Sign up for Github

   Please make an account at https://github.com/.

** Install Git

*** Git for Windows
    - https://gitforwindows.org/

*** Git for Mac
    - With homebrew: ~brew install git~
    - Or with MacPorts: ~sudo port install git +svn +doc
      +bash_completion +gitweb~
    - Or with the Git installer (if you don't have homebrew or
      MacPorts already installed): https://git-scm.com/download/mac

*** Third option: do everything on the cloud with Github

   - You can still participate in the workshop without Git installed,
     but I recommend installing it for future use.

   - If you prefer this option, here are instricutions to make edits
     directly on Github:

           - https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/


** What are Git and Github

   - Git was created for collaborative software development. It tracks
     all changes made to files, and can merge changes made separately
     by different people.
   - Github is a web platform made by Microsoft that hosts Git projects
     and provides complementary tools.

** Git steps in command form

   - ~git add <filename>~ : stage a file to be commited
   - ~git commit~ : make a commit with a message
   - ~git push~ : push your changes to remote repository (backup)

** Github features

   https://github.com/massma/ltf-github-website-courses

** How can these features be useful for deploying and organizing materials?

   - take a moment to write a few thoughts down on your own, in your
     text editor or on scrap paper (1 min)
   - share your thoughts with the person next to you (3 min)
   - group discussion (3-5 min)

** Let's collaborate on this workshop.

    - fork the repository
    - enable github pages
    - edit workshop files (*.md) to improve the workshop on Github, or
       - submit an issue
       - clone the repository locally and edit with the text editor of your choice (recommeneded if you anticipate using these tools a lot)
